            I am an Information Systems student at Universitas Pembangunan
            Nasional "Veteran" Jakarta with professional experience as a
            Front-End Developer in building responsive and dynamic user
            interfaces. Focusing on modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Next.js, I have the
            ability to create optimal user experiences. Currently, I serve as a
            Front-End Developer in a campus organization, where I enhance my
            technical skills and collaborate within a team to complete web-based
            projects.
