          I am an Information Systems student at Universitas Pembangunan
          Nasional "Veteran" Jakarta with professional experience as a Front-End
          Developer in building responsive and dynamic user interfaces. Focusing
          on modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
          frameworks like React and Next.js, I have the ability to create
          optimal user experiences. Currently, I serve as a Front-End Developer
          in a campus organization, where I enhance my technical skills and
          collaborate within a team to complete web-based projects.
